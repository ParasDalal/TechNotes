# Prompt Engineering

- Prompt can be phrase or step-by-step of instructions

- Effective prompt

  - Use natural language
  - Consider context
  - Can cater to specific industry or audience segment

- Process

  - Identify desired outcome
  - Develop set of potential prompts
  - Test and collect data on prompt performance
  - Analyze and evaluate results
  - Refine and iterate

- Types of prompts

  - Direct prompts - direct question
  - Instruction based prompts - Generate actionable details
  - Conversational prompts - ask advice or suggestion (need more context)
  - Counterfactual prompts - what-if scenario for alternative possibilities
  - Creative prompts - imaginative content generation

- Components of prompt

  - Instruction - what task is to be performed
  - Context - external information or additional details for better response
  - Input data - Data that model should use
  - Output indicator - language, structure

- Context

  - Surrounding information
  - Can have maximum number of tokens (based on model)
  - Can contain cue - list, explain

- Problems with prompts

  - Ambiguous context
  - Bias
  - Can generate inconsistent responses
  - Multi-faceted questions are difficult for model (decompose)
  - How and Why questions are sometimes difficult (can result into generic answers)
  - Ethical concerns

- Techniques of better prompts

  - Give unambiguous context

  - Break down task into smaller steps

  - Restrict output (list x number of things)

  - Provide background information if possible

  - Iterative prompting
