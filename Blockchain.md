- How

- - Block - transaction from previous 10 minutes
  - Block is linked to previous block
  - Everything is timestamped

- Financial Industry

- - No settlement - payment and settlement is the same activity 

- Ethereum - has smart contracts

- Bitcoin is a transaction ledger, but Ethereum is a balance ledger

- Good ledger
  - Immutable
  - Timestamp
  - Record of parties of the transaction or who has the balance
  - Accuracy
  - Description of transaction

Introduction to Blockchain
-	Distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network
-	Guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data
-	Does not need a trusted third party for such guarantee
-	Information is made up of "blocks" (with certain storage capacities)
-	Once the block is full, it is closed and linked to previously filled block
	That is why the name Block-chain MT
-	Each block is given exact timestamp when it is added to the chain
-	Data once entered cannot be changed
-	Data is secured by
		Proof of work - use of hash (one way function)
		Proof of Stake - various parties validates the block
		Proof of Burn - Give the actual coin to get the right to create block
Current uses of Blockchain at various places
-	Crypto currencies
	Bitcoin (uses SHA-256 hash)
-	Any kind of ledger of transactions (Distributed ledger technology DLT)
-	Decentralized finance (DeFi)
-	Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
-	Smart contracts
