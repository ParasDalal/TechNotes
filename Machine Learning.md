# Machine Learning

- Prediction is key ingredient in decision making
- Machine learning is about learning from data and turning it into predictions
- It can produce better, faster and cheaper predictions than humans can
- ML uses data to create its own rules, guided by the goal defined by humans
- Deep learning is type of algorithm that  is adaptable to varying complexities of data and rules
- Data
  - Data can have properties (features)
  - Different values of each data point in dataset makes them unique
- Target
  - What we want to predict given the dataset
- When a ML is given data point properties and corresponding targets for learning, it is called supervised learning
- Training the model = Process by which dataset containing features and targets are used to get "model"
- We can keep a portion of dataset for testing (once the model training is complete)
  - We provide the model with features and ask the trained model to predict the target values
